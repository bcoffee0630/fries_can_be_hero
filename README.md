# FriesCanBeHero 🍟🦸‍♂️

**FriesCanBeHero** is a light-hearted arcade-style game created for a GameJam.

## 🧠 Concept

In a city plagued by **French Fry Withdrawal Syndrome**, only one hero can bring salvation—**you**!  
Play as the **Fries Hero**, draw fry shapes with speed and accuracy, and fire crispy salvation at those in desperate need of fries.

## 🎮 Gameplay

- Each round lasts **60 seconds**
- Use your **mouse** or **finger** to draw the shape of a fry
- Fire the fry to **save citizens** affected by fry withdrawal

Be fast. Be precise. Be the hero your city deserves.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Built with **Unity**
- Gesture recognition powered by [PDollarUnity](https://github.com/DaVikingCode/PDollar-Unity), an open-source implementation of the $P Point-Cloud Recognizer (BSD-3 License)
